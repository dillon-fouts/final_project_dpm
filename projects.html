        <h2 class="project-header">Marketplace Simulation Certification</h2>
        <p>As part of my academic growth and practical business training, I successfully completed a Marketplace Simulation, earning recognition among the top performers worldwide. This simulation is a valuable tool for understanding the complexities of managing a business in a competitive environment.</p>
        <p>This hands-on experience allowed me to apply business theories in a simulated marketplace, developing skills in strategic planning, financial analysis, and operational management. Achieving a place in the top 10% worldwide and earning the 1st Place Team badge stands as a testament to my and my team's dedication and understanding of effective business strategies.</p>

            <h2 class="project-header">College Majors Database Project</h2>
            <p>In collaboration with Megan Mullarkey, Tyler Noga, Allison Hersom, and Lucas Hayes, I contributed to the creation of a web-based database application aimed at guiding individuals through the selection of college majors based on post-graduate employment data and salary expectations.</p>
            <p>The project leveraged a dataset from the “The Economic Guide to Picking a College Major” and included comprehensive data on 173 majors. This data encompassed employment statistics, median salaries, and other crucial metrics, transformed into a searchable, user-friendly database interface.</p>
            <p>Through meticulous data normalization, ER diagramming, and SQL schema design, we built a platform that not only provided key insights into career prospects but also honed our skills in database management and application development.</p>
            <p>Although the web application is not currently hosted online, the project was a pivotal experience in practical database application and user interface design. Below, you can find materials related to the project, including our final report and visual aids that outline the database's structure and functionality.</p>
